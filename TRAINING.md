We got a lot of help from AMD mentors for the training part :)


Us three took turns controlling the leader arm, teleoperating the follower arm to pick up a marshmallow and place it onto the platform--already loaded with chocolate and graham crackers. After creating a huge dataset (69 episodes!), we used LeRobot to train the SO-101 arm.
